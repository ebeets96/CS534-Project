Running the Colorizer.py script

Put all the training images in train/, test images in test/. Output will be in result/

Make sure images are 256 x 256 in size. I have found this to be a pretty good size. The model architecture is built assuming this as the image size. If you do change th size make sure it is a power of 2

Vary only the epochs in model.fit_generator(). Epochs below 1000 don't produce good enough results. 1000 is just good enough to give good results on the training set.
Don't worry about the warning it gives at the end.

There are a ton of variables such as number of layers, image size, number of epoch etc that can be optimized. I have only been able to test a few of them. Working on the model so it can perform better on test data
